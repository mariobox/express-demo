# Express Demo

This is a basic dynamic site made with ExpressJS, a light-weight web framework for NodeJS. It uses basic and dynamic routes.

For simplicity, all our functionality has been included in the <code>app.js</code> file.

You can see the site in action [here](https://mjq48.sse.codesandbox.io/).
